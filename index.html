<h3>Assistive Technology Devices</h3>

<p>We are the creators of an affordable Assistive Technology device which allows the control of iOS, Android, and Windows 8 devices via asstive switches (i.e. button switch, sip and puff switch, etc).

<p>We've crafted some iOS apps for ourselves and 3rd Parties. PumpAction is an example of a simple, fun application we have listed out on the appstore.  We also worked with Gymbor to create their iOS application. If there's something that you think we can help you out with, dont' hesistate to contact us.</p>
